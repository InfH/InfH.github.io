Together with David DeTomaso and Andrey Indukaev, I planned a presentation on the basics of data tidying and transformation, performing the same operations in parallel for R & Python, demonstrating the versatility of both languages for data analysis. I presented the R sections while David presented the Python sections. The Jupyter Notebooks we used are located in [github.com/diyadas/tutorials](https://github.com/diyadas/tutorials).
