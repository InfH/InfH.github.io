I gave a presentation on the basics of Git and GitHub, geared towards first-time users in collaborative settings. This was the first day of a series of tutorials I am organizing for the 2017 CDIPS Data Science Workshop. Thanks to sponsorship from the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, the tutorials are free and open to the public. The presentation is located in [github.com/diyadas/yagt](https://github.com/diyadas/yagt).
