Following my presentation with David DeTomaso on data transformation in R & Python, I am planning a presentation on the basics of visualization in R, to be followed by a parallel presentation in Python by David on April 18. The Jupyter Notebooks we will use are located in [github.com/diyadas/tutorials](https://github.com/diyadas/tutorials).
