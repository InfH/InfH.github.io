The [Student Health Advisory Committee](http://uhs.berkeley.edu/students/SHAC/) is an advisory committee to University Health Services, comprised of representatives of Berkeley student communities. The committee meets monthly during the academic year to address student concerns regarding health services. 

__Roles__: I served as one of three graduate student at-large representatives for four years. I also provided student input at UHS staff meetings and interviews of potential UHS hires (health educator, psychiatrist, psychologist).
