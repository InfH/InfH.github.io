The [MCB Graduate Student Organization](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/groups/gso) serves as a liaison between the Graduate Assembly, the department, and our fellow students. GSO members actively participate in graduate recruitment, departmental seminars, faculty search committees, and policy decisions.

__Roles__: I joined the GSO through my election to the [Graduate Affairs Committee](/portfolio/6-GAC) and was elected Secretary of the GSO by my fellow officers for two years. During this period, I:
- Coordinated a much-needed website redesign, with the outgoing secretary
- Helped update the constitution, to match existing processes and clarify language
- Coordinated meetings and votes
- Served as liaison between the GSO and other campus groups, as maintainer of the website and email account

I remained an officer of the GSO through June 2017, as liaison to the MCB Graduate Student & Alumni Association.
