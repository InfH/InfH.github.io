The Best Practices and Meta-Research Working Group is a cross-disciplinary working group at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science that discusses technical and social aspects of how data scientists work.

We've produced a number of reports on challenges of working in teams, diversity and inclusion, resistance to adoption of best practices, and managing turnover in data science groups. They are [available on OSF/SocArxiv](https://osf.io/ctfqn/).
