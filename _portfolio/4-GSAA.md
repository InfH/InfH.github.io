The [MCB Graduate Student & Alumni Association](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/group/mcb_alumni) is a graduate student-led organization to promote relationships between current graduate students, alumni, and the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology at UC Berkeley. The GSAA programs several social events each year, facilitates coffee & careers meetups between alumni and students, and organizes career development panels, alumni roundtables, and alumni seminars.

__Roles__: I served as Co-President for the first two years of our existence, overseeing all of our activities and responding to queries from students and alumni.
