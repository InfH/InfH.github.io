The [MCB Graduate Student & Alumni Association](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/group/mcb_alumni) is a graduate student-led organization to promote relationships between current graduate students, alumni, and the Department of Molecular & Cell Biology at UC Berkeley. We program several social events each year, organize coffee & careers meetups between alumni and students, and organize career development panels, alumni roundtables, and alumni seminars.

__Roles__: I've served as Co-President since our formation, overseeing all of our activities and responding to queries from students and alumni.
