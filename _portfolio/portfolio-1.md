title: "Beyond Academia"
excerpt: "Beyond Academia is a group of approximately 15 graduate student and postdoctoral researchers at UC Berkeley whose mission is to provide opportunities for our peers to explore careers outside of the tenure track. Our flagship event is a two-day conference featuring dozens of professionals with PhDs who have successfully transitioned to careers outside the tenure track. 
I joined the BA team in May 2016, and serve in a number of capacities. 
* Development committee: long-term planning for the organization. * Logistics committee: venue, catering, day-of logistics for the conference.
* Speakers committee: coordinator of 3 panels: Data Science, Technical & Specialized Consulting, and Transitioning into Tech; and 1 seminar: Acquiring Quantitative & Technical Skills at Berkeley
* Also helping plan the Professional Profile Clinic."
