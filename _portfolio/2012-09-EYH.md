[Expanding Your Horizons at Berkeley](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eyh/) is a graduate student organization at UC Berkeley that plans an annual day of hands-on workshops for middle school girls to encourage their pursuits in STEM fields. I joined the planning committee of approximately 40 students in its second year, for which we expanded the conference from ~200 middle school participants to over 300 middle school participants. The conference grew steadily during my tenure, to over 450 middle school participants in 2015.
