I'm a molecular biologist and data scientist, with a primary appointment as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in [John Ngai's lab](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/ngai) at UC Berkeley. I'm also a **Moore-Sloan Data Science Fellow** at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). In both capacities, I study how olfactory stem cells make neurons (or don't) in adults. 

Aside from my research, I care about empowering others with the resources to understand the world. Most recently, this has manifested as serving as a Lesson Maintainer for the Carpentries, an organization that teaches data science and coding skills to researchers around the world. My co-maintainer and I are responsible for integrating updates to the Intro to Programming with R lesson.

**I'm now looking for a new job in industry, as a computational biologist.** My primary expertise is in single-cell genomics, but I'm open to all sorts of opportunities. If you know of a position I might be interested in, please send me an email.

Inspired by my colleagues, I recently decided to map my activities over the past ten years as a visual resume. Aside from its descriptive qualities, this project was a great way to learn more about Google sheets integration with R and ggplot2/grid graphics. The result is below and [the code to make your own visual resume is on GitHub](https://github.com/diyadas/vizresume).
