I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of [Molecular & Cell Biology](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley and a Moore/Sloan Data Science Fellow at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/). I study molecular mechanisms of regeneration in the olfactory epithelium as a member of the [Ngai Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/ngaineuro/). I analyze how olfactory stem cells mediate differentiation and regeneration using single-cell RNA sequencing. I characterize cell types, identify coordinated gene expression to provide insights into potential regulators of these processes, and make inferences about lineage trajectories that describe the paths from quiescent stem cells to differentiated cells. I have also investigated global transcriptional regulation using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin, which highlights regions of the genome that are potentially accessible to transcription factors and other regulators.

I strongly believe in giving people the resources and information they need to achieve their goals. To that end, I'm involved in a number of educational initiatives: 

At BIDS, I serve as the Fellow Lead of [Career Paths & Alternative Metrics Working Group](https://bids.berkeley.edu/working-groups/career-paths-and-alternative-metrics) (chaired by Henry Brady), which aims to identify and promote development of career advancement opportunities for academic data scientists. I also serve as Fellow Representative to the BIDS Executive Committee and as a member of the BIDS Strategic Planning Committee (Summer 2018).

I organize [The Hacker Within](http://thehackerwithin.org/berkeley), a peer learning group for research computing, along with my cohorts [Caroline Cypranowska](http://cypranowska.github.io) and [Stuart Geiger](http://stuartgeiger.com) (who taught us both how to use Jekyll and GitHub pages at a Hacker Within session!). I'm also the Coordinator for BIDS's [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) offerings, as well as being a certified Software Carpentry instructor and maintainer of the Intro to Programming with R [lesson](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).

Until February 2018, I served as Co-Director and Development Lead of [Beyond Academia](http://www.beyondacademia.org), a graduate student organization whose mission is to encourage career exploration among our peers, and was previously a member of the Logistics, Speakers, and Development Committees. During my involvement with Beyond Academia, I worked with a team of ~20 graduate students to organize a two-day conference for 500 people each year. I handled many logistical tasks, such as arranging the conference schedule (with 6 peers) and duty roster for our 30+ volunteers (with 2 others). I also helped reformulate the group's advisory board, seeking out additional members to address gaps in expertise, and focused on team recruiting and professional development.

I was previously Co-Director of the [2017 CDIPS Data Science Workshop](https://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/2017-cdips-data-science-workshop), which encouraged graduate students and postdocs to explore data science via projects. Prior to that, I served as a Finance Agent and Signatory (and budget/grant writer) for the Expanding Your Horizons in Science + Mathematics Conference at Berkeley. I was a graduate student representative on the [Student Health Advisory Committee](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/shac) for four years, as well as several departmental committees.  I also served as student Co-President of the [MCB Graduate Student & Alumni Association](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/group/mcb_alumni), which facilitates relationships between graduate students, alumni, and our department.
