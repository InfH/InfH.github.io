I am a neurodevelopmental biologist applying quantitative methods to make predictions about the regulation of complex biological processes, including stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. As a member of the Ngai Lab, my research is focused on identifying and interpreting lineage trajectories that arise from the stem cells of the olfactory epithelium. 

These normally quiescent stem cells, the horizontal basal cells, become activated and induced to differentiate by both knockout of transcription factor p63 and severe injury to the epithelium. I study both of these processes at the level of individual cells, using single-cell RNA-sequencing.
